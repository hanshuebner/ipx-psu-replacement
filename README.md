# Sun SPARCstation IPC/IPX replacement power supply

I've got tired of unsuccessfully trying to repair the APS-02 power
supply that is built into Sun's SPARCstation IPC and IPX workstations,
so I designed this replacement.  It uses two encapsulated power
supplies and a MAX8215 power supply monitoring chip to generate the
SENS signal.

Here's a picture of my version 1 build.  It has the base load
resistors bodged on.  The layout has been revised since:

Several parts out of the original PSU board are reused and need to be
desoldered:

Another couple of parts need to be bought
